🪨📄✂️ Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
A simple and fun Rock, Paper, Scissors game built with vanilla JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

🎯 Project Objectives
Create a clean layout with three buttons: Rock, Paper, and Scissors 🎮

Play a round against a randomly chosen computer move when the user clicks a button 🤖

Track the player’s and computer’s choices using JavaScript, and determine the winner 🏆

Display a result message after each round (e.g., “Rock beats Scissors 💥”)

Change the background color based on the round outcome:

✅ Green for a win

⚪ Gray for a tie

❌ Red for a loss

Reset the background to the default color if the user is inactive for 3 seconds

💡 Key Concepts Practiced
DOM manipulation

Handling user events and input

Basic game logic

Working without frameworks or libraries

Timers and UI feedback based on state

🚀 Why I Built This
This project was a fun and focused way to sharpen my front-end JavaScript skills while exploring interactive UI behavior. It’s lightweight, intuitive, and perfect for beginners who want to see JavaScript in action without external libraries.
